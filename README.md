# My Dotfiles
It's for my own use, on üíª MacOS, mostly for simple setup of my üßëüèº‚Äçüíª dev environment.

## Pre-requisites
Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and see all packages in `./Brewfile`

### Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vuon9/dotfiles.git
```

### To install softwares
To have the terminal, shell, and command-line tools configured, run the following command:

```bash
brew bundle --file=~/path/to/dotfiles/Brewfile
```
[Read more](https://kevinmgrimes.com/post/homebrew-macos/) and [also this](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f) to understand Brewfile usages and tips.

### To use dotfiles
After having all softwares installed, can use the dotfiles by symlinking them to the home directory.

```bash
# Backup current config
mv ~/.config/fish ~/.config/fish.bak
mv ~/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig.bak
mv ~/.config/.wezterm.lua ~/.config/.wezterm.lua.bak

# Apply config from this folder as symlink
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/fish ~/.config/fish
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/.wezterm.lua ~/.config/.wezterm.lua

# Addtional in case using Go
mv ~/.golangci.yml ~/.golangci.yml.bak
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/.golangci.yml ~/.golangci.yml
```

### Customized CommitMono font
I use [CommitMono](https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono) but I customized it a bit to make it more readable with my personal preference. Can find the font in `./fonts` folder.
1. To install the font, just double click on the font file and click `Install Font` button.
2. To use it in editor, terminal, etc. need to set it 'CommitMono-Vng' as the font name.
